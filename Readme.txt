1. Function Declarations:
Learn the syntax for declaring functions and understand how they differ from executable statements. Discover how declared functions are stored for later use, waiting to be invoked when needed. See practical examples of function declarations and grasp the role of semicolons in JavaScript statements.

2. Function Expressions:
Explore an alternative way of defining functions using expressions. Witness how function expressions can be stored in variables, providing flexibility in their usage. Uncover the concept of anonymous functions and the role of semicolons in executable statements. See examples of invoking functions stored in variables.

3. The Function() Constructor:
Dive into the Function() constructor, a built-in JavaScript function constructor. Understand its usage and compare it with regular function expressions. Learn how to create functions using the constructor and explore scenarios where using the constructor might be beneficial.

4. Function Hoisting:
Revisit the concept of hoisting in JavaScript, focusing on its application to both variable and function declarations. Understand how functions can be called before they are formally declared, with practical examples illustrating the concept.

5. Self-Invoking Functions:
Discover the concept of self-invoking function expressions. Witness how these functions automatically start without explicit calls and explore the syntax required for creating them. Understand the distinction between self-invoking expressions and function declarations.

6. Functions as Values:
Learn how JavaScript functions can be used as values in expressions. Explore scenarios where functions play a role in computations and how they can be an integral part of JavaScript code.

7. Functions as Objects:
Uncover the dual nature of JavaScript functions. While the typeof operator labels them as "function," delve into the fact that functions are also objects with properties and methods. Explore examples showcasing the arguments.length property and the toString() method.

8. Arrow Functions:
Embark on the journey of modern JavaScript with arrow functions. Understand their concise syntax and how they differ from traditional function expressions. Explore scenarios where arrow functions shine and grasp the importance of const for declaring them.
